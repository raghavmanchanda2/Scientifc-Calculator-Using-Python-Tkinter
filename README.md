# Introduction

Introducing "Scientific-Calculator-Using Python Tkinter," a project designed to leverage Python's Tkinter alongside the time and math modules for precise calculations. This calculator employs advanced mathematical functionalities facilitated by the math module while integrating time module features for error handling, ensuring a seamless user experience. In case of errors, the time module efficiently clears the screen, guaranteeing smooth functionality and accuracy throughout calculations.

# Modules

The modules used in the code are:

- `tkinter` (imported as `*`)
- `tkinter.messagebox` (aliased as `tmsg`)
- `os`
- `time`
- `math`
